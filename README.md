# Wine-Classification
Worked on the famous wine classification dataset which consists of several features of wine in order to predict its quality. Used many data visualisation tools and built a KNN classifier model which sets an arbitrary cutoff 7 and classifies the wine as good or not good. The model achieved an accuracy of 93%.
